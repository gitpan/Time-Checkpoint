This is a very tiny module. It isn't intended to solve all your problems,
or anyone else's. It's simply a piece of code that I found myself using
frequently enough that I decided it would be a good idea for it to be
on the CPAN (and besides, somebody was probably doing something similar
anyways).

If you use this module and would like to see it more formally supported,
let me know. As far as I know, there is precisely one user other than
myself out there.

I should probably move this into the Benchmark:: tree or deprecate it as
some of its functionality is present in the Benchmark module itself.
