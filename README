This is a very tiny module. It isn't intended to solve all your problems,
or anyone else's. It's simply a piece of code that I found myself using
frequently enough that I decided it would be a good idea for it to be
on the CPAN (and besides, somebody was probably doing something similar
anyways).

I don't want to hear how this is a waste of space or time.  If you
consider it so, please send your local congressman a letter (on *any*
issue!) rather than waste the effort on me.
