Version 0.02 - Original release ca. 17 Aug 2004
	Initial implementation

Version 0.1 - Sun Oct  9 03:24:58 EDT 2011
	Updated to push to github, cleaned up so I could live with it.
	Eked out 3% improvement in execution speed through use of 'state' feature.
	Found a minor bug in a test.
	There's now relatively little difference in overhead between using a callback and not using
		a callback, except the actual callback code itself.

Version 0.35 - See above version.
	Consolidated a versioning error on PAUSE (which was my fault, I guess.)
